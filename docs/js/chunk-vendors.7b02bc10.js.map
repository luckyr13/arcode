Such a property should contain a `&` character, which\n// will be replaced by the current selector. For example `{\"&:before\":\n// {content: '\"hi\"'}}`.

For\n// example to create a media query you can do `{\"@media screen and\n// (min-width: 400px)\": {...}}`.\n","'use strict';\nvar fails = require('../internals/fails');\nvar isCallable = require('../internals/is-callable');\nvar create = require('../internals/object-create');\nvar getPrototypeOf = require('../internals/object-get-prototype-of');\nvar redefine = require('../internals/redefine');\nvar wellKnownSymbol = require('../internals/well-known-symbol');\nvar IS_PURE = require('../internals/is-pure');\n\nvar ITERATOR = wellKnownSymbol('iterator');\nvar BUGGY_SAFARI_ITERATORS = false;\n\n// `%IteratorPrototype%` object\n// https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-%iteratorprototype%-object\nvar IteratorPrototype, PrototypeOfArrayIteratorPrototype, arrayIterator;\n\n/* eslint-disable es/no-array-prototype-keys -- safe */\nif ([].keys) {\n  arrayIterator = [].keys();\n  // Safari 8 has buggy iterators w/o `next`\n  if (!('next' in arrayIterator)) BUGGY_SAFARI_ITERATORS = true;\n  else {\n    PrototypeOfArrayIteratorPrototype = getPrototypeOf(getPrototypeOf(arrayIterator));\n    if (PrototypeOfArrayIteratorPrototype !== Object.prototype) IteratorPrototype = PrototypeOfArrayIteratorPrototype;\n  }\n}\n\nvar NEW_ITERATOR_PROTOTYPE = IteratorPrototype == undefined || fails(function () {\n  var test = {};\n  // FF44- legacy iterators case\n  return IteratorPrototype[ITERATOR].call(test) !== test;\n});\n\nif (NEW_ITERATOR_PROTOTYPE) IteratorPrototype = {};\nelse if (IS_PURE) IteratorPrototype = create(IteratorPrototype);\n\n// `%IteratorPrototype%[@@iterator]()` method\n// https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-%iteratorprototype%-@@iterator\nif (!isCallable(IteratorPrototype[ITERATOR])) {\n  redefine(IteratorPrototype, ITERATOR, function () {\n    return this;\n  });\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  IteratorPrototype: IteratorPrototype,\n  BUGGY_SAFARI_ITERATORS: BUGGY_SAFARI_ITERATORS\n};\n","'use strict';\nvar TO_STRING_TAG_SUPPORT = require('../internals/to-string-tag-support');\nvar classof = require('../internals/classof');\n\n// `Object.prototype.toString` method implementation\n// https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-object.prototype.tostring\nmodule.exports = TO_STRING_TAG_SUPPORT ?
